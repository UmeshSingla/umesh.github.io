including the popular <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/">WP Smush Plugin</a> along with it’s API development using various image optimization libraries.</p>

<p>As a part of DEV team I’ve actively worked on Plugin development which included adding new features, bug fixes and handling plugin releases along with handling support requests occasionally as a project owner.
I started with working on MarketPress( A WooCommerce alternative, now retired ) bitcoin payment gateway integration, then helped with Pro Sites plugin. Further I took up Smush and worked on multiple major releases.</p>

<p>One of the challenging project during the tenure was bbPress migration for WPMU DEV site forum. Having around 1.2 million posts with attachments along with additional functionality it was a challenging task ensuring lower downtime.</p>

<p>In 3rd and 4th year of my degree I worked on PHP Web application for our Training and Placement cell along with a small web application for Internet access management of the college students.
The application designed for the Placement cell was in use for at least 3-4 years until when they finally got a better application to work with.:D</p>
